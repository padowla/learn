## About Me

Welcome to my learning space where curiosity is the driving force. My name is Samuele and i love the vast realm of IT Security.

🤝 **Knowledge Sharing:** Knowledge grows when shared. Connect with me, share our experiences, insights, and discoveries. Together, we create an environment where everyone benefits from the collective wisdom of the community.

:recycle: **Continuous Discovery:** Knowledge is dynamic and ever-evolving, for that reason I don't feel that I have ever arrived at any point, and every opportunity is a good opportunity to learn!

🐇 **Follow the White Rabbit:** Like Alice chasing the elusive white rabbit, you're invited to follow your curiosity with me.

🖥️ **Hands-On Experience:** I believe in the "learn by doing" philosophy. Explore real-world scenarios, test my skills, and enhance my capabilities through practical, hands-on experiences.
